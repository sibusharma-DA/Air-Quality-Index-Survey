# Air-Quality-Index-Survey

🌪️ Air pollution doesn’t check your wallet — but your hospital bill will.
That was the bold starting point of my submission for the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge, where I reimagined Redmi’s air purifier market strategy using real AQI insights.

In this project, I built a Power BI dashboard and data-driven roadmap to help Redmi target the right cities, at the right time, with the right features.

🔍 The problem:
India’s air pollution crisis isn’t uniform —

Delhi chokes on PM2.5 year-round

Punjab suffers seasonal spikes from crop burning

Karnataka deals with dust from construction
Yet, most air purifiers in the market follow a “one-size-fits-all” approach.

📊 The project:
My 3-page Power BI dashboard analyzed:
➡️ AQI trends for 2022–2025 across 100+ cities
➡️ Seasonal & regional pollution patterns
➡️ City ranking based on AQI × Population × Income
➡️ Price segmentation opportunities for Tier 1–3 cities
➡️ Competitive positioning of Redmi vs. market leaders

💡 Key insights I uncovered:
➡️ Smaller towns like Byrnihat surpassed metro AQI levels
➡️ AQI spikes directly drive purifier search trends
➡️ ₹20K spent on a purifier can offset ₹40K+ in respiratory treatments
➡️ Certain states show irreversible AQI decline despite policy changes

🚀 What I delivered:
✅ A Redmi city priority index for targeted sales
✅ Tiered pricing recommendations for different income segments
✅ Seasonal campaign ideas aligned with pollution peaks
✅ Feature suggestions — AI air quality sync, predictive alerts, compact design for small apartments
✅ Integration of Google Trends & AQI data for demand forecasting
